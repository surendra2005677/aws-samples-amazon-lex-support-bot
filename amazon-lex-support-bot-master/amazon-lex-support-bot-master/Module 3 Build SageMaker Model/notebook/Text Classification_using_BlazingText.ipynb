    "# Text Classification using SageMaker's BlazingText\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Classification can be used to solve various use-cases like sentiment analysis, spam detection, hashtag prediction etc. This notebook demonstrates the use of SageMaker built-in algorithm, BlazingText to perform supervised multi class with single or multi label text classification. BlazingText can train the model on more than a billion words in a couple of minutes using a multi-core CPU or a GPU, while achieving performance on par with the state-of-the-art deep learning text classification algorithms. BlazingText extends the fastText text classifier to leverage GPU acceleration using custom CUDA kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this use case, we will be using utterances of intents for Amazon Lex chatbot that manages support cases as dataset. The model built using the utteraces dataset will predict which intent it belongs to when it was missed by the chatbot. "
